# Able Lubes Inventory & Billing API

TypeScript, Express 5, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM 7 and Zod backend for one lubricant shop. The API is organized as a feature-based monolith: each business feature owns its routes, controller, service, model, request schema and serializer. REST endpoints are under `/api/v1`; interactive OpenAPI docs are available at `/docs`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or later
- PostgreSQL 15 or later
- npm

## Setup

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set DATABASE_URL, a long JWT_SECRET, and ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm install
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate -- --name init
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

The Prisma 7 generator writes its client into `generated/prisma`. Prisma CLI datasource configuration is in `prisma.config.ts`; runtime PostgreSQL queries use `@prisma/adapter-pg`. Do not edit generated client files or commit `.env`.

For production, run `npm run build`, then `npm run db:deploy`, then `npm start`. Set production secrets through the deployment environment.

## Environment

See `.env.example`. `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is required only when seeding the initial administrator. The seed hashes the password and upserts one admin account. Do not use example credentials outside local development.

## API overview

All routes other than health and login require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login` | Get a JWT |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/users` | Admin-only staff/admin account creation |
| GET, POST | `/api/v1/products` | Search/list and create products |
| GET, PATCH | `/api/v1/products/:id` | Read/update product details; stock is never directly writable |
| GET, POST, PATCH | `/api/v1/customers` | Manage customers |
| GET, POST, PATCH | `/api/v1/suppliers` | Manage suppliers |
| POST | `/api/v1/purchases` | Post purchase and increase stock atomically |
| POST | `/api/v1/sales` | Post sale and decrease stock atomically |
| POST | `/api/v1/customer-payments` | Record a cash/UPI payment against one invoice |
| POST | `/api/v1/supplier-payments` | Record a supplier payment against one purchase |
| POST | `/api/v1/sales/:id/cancel` | Admin-only cancellation and stock restoration |
| POST | `/api/v1/purchases/:id/cancel` | Admin-only cancellation and stock reversal |
| GET, POST, PATCH | `/api/v1/expenses` | List, create and update expenses |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/sales?from=...&to=...` | Daily sales totals and date-range totals |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/purchases?from=...&to=...` | Purchase report |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/expenses?from=...&to=...` | Expense report |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/customers/outstanding` | Customer invoice balances |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/suppliers/outstanding` | Supplier purchase balances |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/monthly?from=...&to=...` | Monthly sales, purchases and expenses |

Requests that post sales/purchases require a unique `idempotencyKey` in the JSON body; repeat submissions with the same key return the original invoice. A sale's products, prices and totals come from the database/server calculation. Customer/supplier payments must be linked to one invoice and may not exceed its remaining amount. Cash and UPI are recorded as actual payments; an unpaid invoice is credit. A sale without a customer can still receive a payment linked to its invoice.

List endpoints support `page`, `limit` (maximum 100), and `search`. Dates are ISO 8601. Monetary and quantity values are returned as decimal strings where applicable.

## Business-rule defaults and limits

- Units are stored as text on Product; no dynamic Unit table is used.
- Tax is omitted until tax treatment/rates are confirmed.
- Purchase `our rate` is omitted until its meaning is defined.
- Sale cost snapshot is nullable. No gross/net profit figures are reported until the costing method is agreed.
- Customer/supplier advances and overpayments are rejected; payment allocation across invoices is not supported.
- Cancellation restores stock only once by changing the posted record's state within the same transaction. A sale/purchase with linked payments cannot be cancelled through this API; payment reversal/refund handling must be defined before paid invoices can be reversed.
- Product stock can only change through posted purchase/sale workflows; no stock-adjustment endpoint exists.
- All inventory quantities use three decimal places. Change this after confirming packaging/unit precision.
- Reports group dates in `Asia/Kolkata`; `from` and `to` are inclusive ISO date/time instants. Supply explicit time offsets when the reporting window is local business time.

These rules are documented defaults, not assumptions about tax or profit accounting. Revise the schema before the first migration if the business confirms different policies.

## Verification

Run `npm test` for focused tests around decimal line/invoice calculations and stock comparison. Run `npm run build` for TypeScript compilation. API/database integration scenarios require a configured PostgreSQL database and should be verified against the local database before deployment.

## Postman smoke tests

Import `postman/Able-Lubes-API.postman_collection.json` into Postman. Set its `adminPassword` collection variable to the same value as `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`, run `npm run db:seed`, start the API, and run the collection from top to bottom with Collection Runner. It covers every current API route, including GET/POST/PATCH for CRUD-capable resources, invoice/payment flows, cancellation, and reports. It creates dummy customer, supplier, product, purchase, sale, payment, and expense data; it also checks idempotent retries and oversell rejection. Product/customer/supplier delete behavior is tested as soft deactivation with `PATCH active=false`. The API does not expose hard DELETE or PUT, nor sale/purchase reads or expense detail. Running the collection more than once creates additional dummy records.
